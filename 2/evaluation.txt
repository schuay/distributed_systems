Linux 3.6.7, 1x Intel Pentium 4, 3,6 GHz, 2G RAM
clients = 70
auctionsPerMin = 400
auctionDuration = 200
updateIntervalSec = 1 # can't be decreased further
bidsPerMin = 9000

Increasing these values resulted in processes getting killed.

Linux jsrv64 3.6.8-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Mon Nov 26 22:10:40 CET 2012 x86_64 GNU/Linux
Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU     E6850  @ 3.00GHz
6 GB Memory

clients = 8388608
auctionsPerMin = 60000
auctionDuration = 2000
updateIntervalSec: 1
bidsPerMin = 60000

auctionsPerMin and bidsPerMin are at their maximum values, updateIntervalSec
is at its minimum, and I stopped increasing clients when I reached 8388608.
The system was still running without issues.
